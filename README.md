ZAKA Capstone Project - Shelf Planogram Detection

This is an attempt to aid supermarkets and brands 
standardize the placement of products on retail shelves using image recognition and 
object detection. By simply relying on a picture of their pre-existing aisle division 
schemes, our system can accurately determine whether an image of an aisle abides by 
the given planogram (the right products as well as their order). Also, not only will it 
point out whether it fits the scheme or not, it will notify the customer of the flaw in 
their existing planning. This step-by-step strategy ensures that the program is accessible 
to an extremely wide audience.
